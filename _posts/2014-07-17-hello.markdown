Hello everyone and welcome to my entirely new site. It's hosted on Github pages using Jekyll. This was actually surprisingly easy to setup, had I known how simple it was I wouldn't have put it off so much. I'm even able to post code snippets cleanly which I'm excited about.

Here is an example in Rust:

{% highlight rust %}
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!")
}
#=> prints "Hello World"
{% endhighlight %}

Anywho, this is my spot on the internet and I'll be posting here. Feel free to follow me on Twitter [@angelcasado](https://twitter.com/angelcasado).
