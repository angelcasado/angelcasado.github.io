Swift was announced a little over a year ago at WWDC 2014. Needless to say I was very excited for the new language and have been using it since day one. This opportunity doesn't come along all the time; to use a language and watch it improve so rapidly is awesome. You could say it is history in the making and I am glad to be apart of it. Clearly Swift would be the successor to Objective-C; at 1.0 it was ready for production which says a lot. Some called me mad for adopting so early but incase you aren't familiar with Apple, when they release something it’s usually a big hint. If the hint wasn't obvious last year it should be clear this year with what was announced at WWDC 2015. If you were reluctant to try it now is the time.

## Experience

In the past year using Swift has improved my programming skills by allowing me to apply new paradigms and techniques. Swift's functional capabilities make programming a joy and have opened my eyes to flaws in class design. I find myself asking totally new questions: Is this more of a value or reference type? Do I need state here? Should I really subclass?

Obviously such a young language is not very optimized and bugs do happen. Xcode 6 would crash constantly. Very slow compile times. Compiler errors and warning messages were cryptic but have improved. Autocomplete was a major pain but it was nothing compared to when SourceKit crashed inside Xcode wiping out all syntax highlighting. This wasn't enough to prevent me from using it and nothing was going to stop me from that.

Swift has improved and its most improved form came with the 1.2 packaged with Xcode 6.3. This release was a major gain in productivity and features. Compile time isn't as fast as Objective-C and autocomplete is a bit slow but none of the problems above apply anymore.

## Production ready?

What about in production? When the language came out my bosses asked me if we could rewrite a failing app in Swift. I told him and her: "Yes". A client once asked me if Swift was ready and I said: "Yes". You probably think I'm crazy or a masochist but I knew this language was the way forward. I trusted that Apple wouldn't give me something broken and unusable. There was no way Apple could turn its back on a language that was being developed for four years. What amazed me more was that I was being asked to use it in production and that non-technical people were asking me about it.

## A Brave New World

Over the past five years languages like Go, Rust, and Swift have been created and released to solve every programmers’ problem. Complexity. As time goes on we find ourselves in bigger teams, developing more in smaller time frames. These languages were created out of necessity. A lot of these new languages are being built to scale with products and their teams. Why write it in C++ if you can write it faster in Go or Rust and probably get improved performance? The tech world and their requirements are changing fast, and you'll need a language that can scale with it.

## What's next?

Swift 2.0 will be out at the end of this year and will be open sourced with support for Linux. I can't wait to start using Swift server side and seeing what kind of benefits you can get from using it. I'll gladly take all the new features along with all the breaking changes.
