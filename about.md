I'm a software developer from Miami. I build REST API backend services and iOS apps on the frontend. Every once in a while I take to the design side of things. I'm also a huge fan of basketball, unix, cooking, and keeping things simple.

Founder of [Nocturne](http://nocturne.digital), where we create solid iOS apps and services.
