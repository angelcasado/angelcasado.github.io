I'm a software developer from Miami. I build REST API services in Ruby on Rails on the backend and iOS apps on the frontend. Every once in a while I take to the design side of things. I'm also a huge fan of basketball, unix, cooking, and keeping things simple.

Earlier this year I founded [Nocturne](http://nocturne.digital) where we create iOS apps and REST APIs. <span class="green-color">We are currently accepting new projects.</span>
